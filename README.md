# New Caesar

You may be familiar with [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), but that's not exactly it...

How does the cipher work if the alphabet isn't 26 letters?

Even though the letters are split up, the same paradigms still apply.

How can such meaningless letters convey a message, Can you break the secret code?
